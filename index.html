    <!-- Chosen Palette: Academic Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a top-down narrative dashboard. It begins with an abstract to set the academic context. The core is an interactive line chart showing a synthesized 'Hate Speech Index' over 10 years, allowing users to compare trends across five Western regions. This dashboard design was chosen for its immediacy and intuitive nature, allowing users to see the primary data first. Key interactions include toggling regional data lines and hovering over data points to display contextual analysis in a dedicated panel. This directly links quantitative trends to qualitative drivers. Below the dashboard, collapsible 'Deep Dive' sections provide thematic analysis on recurring issues like economic anxiety and stereotypes, allowing for self-paced, deeper exploration without cluttering the main view. This layered approach serves both the user who wants a quick overview and the researcher who needs detailed context, maximizing usability and information retention. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Report Info: 10-year trend data for 5 regions. Goal: Compare change over time. Viz: Multi-line chart. Interaction: Toggle datasets via buttons; hover for tooltips and detailed analysis panel update. Justification: Line charts are ideal for time-series data. Toggling prevents visual clutter, and the linked analysis panel provides immediate context for data points. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        2. Report Info: Key sociopolitical/media events causing sentiment shifts. Goal: Explain 'why' a data point is high or low. Viz: Dynamic text block. Interaction: Updates on chart hover. Justification: Directly connects quantitative data to qualitative narrative, which is crucial for a sociology report. Method: Vanilla JS DOM manipulation.
        3. Report Info: Recurring themes (immigration, stereotypes). Goal: Organize and provide deep qualitative context. Viz: Accordion-style collapsible sections. Interaction: Click to expand/collapse. Justification: Hides dense information by default, allowing users to explore topics of interest without overwhelming them. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        4. Report Info: Methodology and citations. Goal: Establish academic credibility. Viz: Formatted list with hyperlinks. Interaction: Standard link clicks. Justification: Provides necessary sourcing and transparency in a universally understood format. Method: Standard HTML. -->

The "Hate Speech Index" is a qualitative, synthesized metric (0-100) representing the volume and intensity of negative sentiment, focusing specifically on rhetoric originating from native Western populations. The dashboard below allows for an exploration of these trends, providing context for the socio-political and media events that have influenced public discourse. By hovering over data points on the chart, users can access year-specific analyses. Further thematic explorations are available in the "Deep Dive" sections.</p>

                            <p class="p-5 pt-0 text-gray-600">A significant driver of hateful rhetoric is the projection of **economic anxiety** onto immigrant communities, particularly concerning the technology and medical sectors. Tropes surrounding H-1B visas in the US often frame Indian professionals not as skilled contributors but as a source of "cheap labor" displacing native workers. This narrative intensified during periods of economic downturn, fueled by nationalist and populist rhetoric. Analysis of social media platforms reveals a high correlation between spikes in unemployment figures and an increase in derogatory terms like "tech coolies" or "H1B-ots," creating a permissive environment for digital harassment, as detailed in internal ADL reports.</p>

                            <p class="p-5 pt-0 text-gray-600">Western media portrayals of India's domestic and foreign policy often lack nuance, contributing to negative sentiment. India's policy of non-alignment and its stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, for example, have been framed by some commentators as tacit support for aggression, leading to intense online backlash. Furthermore, internal Indian political events are frequently decontextualized and used by hostile state and non-state actors to paint the Indian diaspora as a monolithic extension of the Indian state. This conflation is a pervasive tactic in **disinformation campaigns** aimed at isolating diaspora communities and eroding social trust.</p>

                            <p class="p-5 pt-0 text-gray-600">Stereotypes rooted in **colonial-era misconceptions** persist and are amplified on social media platforms. This includes the enduring caricature of Indian persons as socially awkward or culturally inferior. More significantly, there has been a documented, structured rise in **Hinduphobia**, as detailed in key reports by NCRI and Rutgers University. This manifests as the weaponization of religious symbols, deliberate misrepresentation of Hindu customs and deities, and the association of Hinduism with extremism. These tropes are employed not only to mock but also to justify discrimination and hate crimes against the diaspora, particularly in the UK and US.</p>
